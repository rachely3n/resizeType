# resizeType
A rather crude javaScript plugin to have fluid typography. 


## Credits

### Based off FlowType.JS 
* because apparently I don't know how to write a basic javaScript plugin
* Well, they've also got a great template/setup and were the inspiration for this plugin.

### Also this article
Tried following the guidelines at https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/
And also random experimentation.
